# Mystic-Axe
Mystic Axe is a 3D third-person video game created in Unity, which I developed over 7 months as the final project for the university course "Video Games and Virtual Reality".
Drawing inspiration from Dark Cloud (Playstation 2) and the acclaimed God of War series, it has been recognized by course professors as the best game ever developed by a student.

You can play with either mouse and keyboard or a gamepad, but I recommend the latter for the best experience.
Various types of gamepads are supported, such as those from PS5, Xbox One and Xbox 360.

This GitHub repository contains both the game build for those interested in trying it out and the C# source code for those curious to explore the underlying mechanics.
Please note that Mystic Axe uses some paid assets I bought; therefore, the repository does not include the entire Unity project with all the assets, in order to avoid copyright violations.
